This is a package for easily performing k-means clustering on a set of data. 
Unique to this implementation is its ability to specify the dimension up to
which the data is clustered. For example::

   >>> from kmeans import cluster
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> np.random.seed(27)   # For reproducible results
   >>> data = np.random.random((15, 5)).round(3)
   >>> data[0]
   array([0.426, 0.815, 0.735, 0.868, 0.383])
   >>> # Cluster using only first two dimensions
   >>> clusters, centroids = cluster(data, k=3, ndim=2, tolerance=0.001)
   >>> centroids
   array([[0.9004  , 0.79    ],
          [0.361375, 0.580125],
          [0.801   , 0.143   ]])
   >>> clusters  # visually compare centroids with first two elements of each data entry.
