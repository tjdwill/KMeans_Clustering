# K Means Clustering
A repository documenting the implementation of k-Means clustering in Python.

This class is now able to cluster non-uniform data, allowing one to keep track of additional info without disorganization.

- _Non-uniform data_: Data that differ in dimension. The program clusters based on the smallest dimension.


Example: k-Means implementation
